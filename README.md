# FastAPI Reverse Image Search & PDF Screenshot Service üöÄ

This project provides a **FastAPI** application that allows you to upload an image. The service uses **Google Cloud Vision** to perform reverse image search and extract text, and **Selenium** with headless Chrome to capture PDF screenshots of webpages where the image is found. All results are logged to a CSV file. A simple HTML frontend is included to make uploading images easier!

## Features ‚ú®

- **Image Upload** üì§: Easily upload an image using the provided web form.
- **Text Extraction** üîç: Extract text from the image using the Google Cloud Vision API.
- **Reverse Image Search** üïµÔ∏è‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è: Identify webpages that include the uploaded image.
- **PDF Screenshot** üìÑ: Generate PDF screenshots of each matching webpage.
- **CSV Logging** üìù: Log results (timestamp, URL, and PDF filename) into a CSV file.
- **Interactive API Documentation** üìë: Test the endpoint via Swagger UI at `/docs`.
